Robert's first message in the document. 

If you are the collaborator:
-load the tidyverse
-read in the kermit data as 'kermit'
-make some side by side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, separated by the Gender column

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

```

```{r}
kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist

```
